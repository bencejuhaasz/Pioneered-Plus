Big thanks Sven Boekelder, aka @timewasternl for creating the awesome skin I'm building on.
(Only reason I'm not forking is new folder structure)

# Features
* Pioneer-style effect chain pack, both for BEAT FX and COLOR FX, with corresponding names and sound profiles
* CDJ/XDJ-like user interface created for touch screens
* Rekordbox USB support: export your library in rekordbox, plug in your USB key into your linux device, and play as you would on a CDJ/XDJ setup. Hotcues, key and bpm info is recognized.
* Corresponding MIDI mapping and js plugin (for DDJ-400 at the time of writing)

# Requirements
* Mixxx built from latest master branch (2.4 alpha)
* Touch screen (will work otherwise, but not as intended)
